TYPO3 JobRouter Extensions
==========================

`JobRouter <https://www.jobrouter.com/>`_ is a scalable digitisation platform
which links processes, data and documents.

There are various TYPO3 extensions available which connect the CMS with
JobRouter:

- :doc:`TYPO3 JobRouter Connector <connector:introduction>`: a base extension
  to define connections to JobRouter installations
- :doc:`TYPO3 JobRouter Data <data:introduction>`: Connect JobData tables
  with TYPO3
- (coming soon) TYPO3 JobRouter Form: Form finishers to push data to JobRouter
  installations

They rely on the :doc:`JobRouter Client <client:introduction>` library.
